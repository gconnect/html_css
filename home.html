                        <p>That is what this training so far has exposed me to. Pushing me to do things that I thought I cant do within a short period of time. Now I know why passion is one of the core value of andela, because when it look as if you have reached the end of the tunnel, it is only passion that will keep you going. It is only passion that has been keeping me going for this two days, not when somebody told me that am not “serious” because I couldn’t complete the day one tasks on time(and I had been working seriously all day just to complete the task to the point that I couldn’t eat), that statement would have easily discourage someone, but passion has been keeping me going, because this is what I want to do”coding”...<a href="https://medium.com/@aladeusiolawalea/andela-bootcamp-day-3-passion-f8acead2ce2e#.itd8y7tv1" class="by">read more</a> </p>
